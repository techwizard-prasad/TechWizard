      <h3>More About College</h3>
      <p>
        Little more than just class, exams and marks I understand it is
        important to have good marks (to be eligible to answer aptitude of
        different companies in the final year). But I feel its way more than
        that. Especially in college. College, probably only time when we are
        adults yet not much of responsibilities. And if we "spend" this amazing
        time only in class and studying then we are losing on a lot of things.
        In my college life in <i title="Goa College Of Enginnering">GEC</i> I
        lived undoubtedly best days of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since first year, I was involved in student's council. I was FE
        Executive of
        <i title="Students' Council of IT Department"> INTENSA </i>. As a part
        of which I was involved in organising Technical Fest called INFOREA.
      </p>
      <p>
        In second year I was Joint Secretory of Nature's Club where we organised
        trek. Amazing experience I must say. In free time I and my friends
        didn't miss any opportunities to go around roaming, swimming and lots of
        other things. Those are some of my favorite memories.
      </p>
      <p>
        In third year, I was Chairman of Students' Council. This was one of the
        best choice I made in my college life. It helped me find a different
        part of myself. It helped me to learn how to handle anormous stress. We
        organised multiple events throughout the year. Best and Biggest being
        HAPPENINGS 2017. It was two days long national level inter-college
        event. During these two days, Students community in Goa as well as
        outside Goa witnessed one of the grandest college event. Happenings 2017
        got footfall of approx 7000 - 8000 people. Day one ended with
        mesmarising performance by Jonita Gandhi, who received Mirchi Award the
        same year. And day 2 was ended with VH1 Supersonic night ft.
        international DJ Zeaden.
      </p>
      <p>
        Final year was more about Project, Hackathons and Demos. There were
        several achivements in terms of our B.E. Project. Major one was winning
        Hackathon in Intercollege Technical festival, Techyon, organised by
        <i title="Padre Conceicao College of Engineering"> PCCE </i>. We were
        awarded as Winning team for Project Presentation at Spectrum, an
        inter-college Technical Fest organised by
        <i title="Goa College Of Enginnering">GEC</i>. And we were also awarded
        for Best Final Year Project of 2017-2018 by Information Technology
        Department, GEC.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only regret I have is that, I didn't put in enough time in
        upskilling myself in technical terms. Given a chance I would like to
        correct my this mistake by learning new technologies and languages.
        Never mind, I still do that.
